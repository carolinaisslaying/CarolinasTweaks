A collection of minor adjustments and tweaks by Carolina to improve your game. This mod only works on Fabric. Non-Fabric support is not planned and will not be added.

## Features
This adds a collection of minor features, such as berry juice, bundle of sticks and compressed cocoa blocks. It also adds a gold painted door and trapdoor, similar to the [Supplementaries](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries) mod, but controllable by redstone in the same way as a typical wood door.

For more information, head over the [Carolina's Tweaks mod wiki](https://github.com/carolinaisslaying/CarolinasTweaks/wiki).

## Installation

Head over the Modrinth page or the releases page on this GitHub and download the latest version that corresponds with your Minecraft version. Then, drop the downloaded file into your mods folder, and if on a server, into your server's mods folder as well..
