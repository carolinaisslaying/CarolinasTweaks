A collection of minor adjustments and tweaks by Carolina to improve your game. This is the NeoForge version of the mod. The Fabric version is no longer the primary focus and I can make no guarantee that it will be maintained. This decision, despite my original intention to never provide a Forge version, is due to the state of Create Fabric which this mod was intended to work alongside.

**Requires the Create mod to work! See your specific version on the version page for the required version of Create.** For older versions of this mod, Create may be optional (if listed).

## Features
This adds a collection of minor features, such as berry juice, bundle of sticks and compressed cocoa blocks. It also adds a gold painted door and trapdoor, similar to the [Supplementaries](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries) mod, but controllable by redstone in the same way as a typical wood door.

For more information, head over the [Carolina's Tweaks mod wiki](https://github.com/carolinaisslaying/CarolinasTweaks/wiki).

## Installation

Head over the Modrinth page or the releases page on this GitHub and download the latest version that corresponds with your Minecraft version. Then, drop the downloaded file into your mods folder, and if on a server, into your server's mods folder as well.
