A collection of minor adjustments and tweaks by Carolina to improve your game. This mod has a NeoForge version, and the Fabric version is no longer the primary focus and I can make no guarantee that it will be maintained. This decision, despite my original intention to never provide a Forge version, is due to the state of Create Fabric which this mod was intended to work alongside.

## ⚠️ WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL MIGRATION VERSION
This is a special version of Carolina's Tweaks v1.3.0. This is only intended to be used if you are migrating your Fabric world to NeoForge.

In that case, while your world is still running Fabric, you must update the Carolina's Tweaks mod to use this special version.

Every user with Carolina's Tweaks blocks, items, etc, must log into the same while this special version of the mod is on the game. Furthermore, a user must go into all of the chunks that hold Carolina's Tweaks blocks/items/etc to update the chunk data.

Once this is complete, you should be able to copy your world files to NeoForge. Ensure that you have the NeoForge version of Carolina's Tweaks installed as well.

Please note, keep a backup of your world files at every stage. This is not a guaranteed fix or migration, it uses a pretty hacky fix that isn't guaranteed to work.

## Features
This adds a collection of minor features, such as berry juice, bundle of sticks and compressed cocoa blocks. It also adds a gold painted door and trapdoor, similar to the [Supplementaries](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries) mod, but controllable by redstone in the same way as a typical wood door.

For more information, head over the [Carolina's Tweaks mod wiki](https://github.com/carolinaisslaying/CarolinasTweaks/wiki).

## Installation

Head over the Modrinth page or the releases page on this GitHub and download the latest version that corresponds with your Minecraft version. Then, drop the downloaded file into your mods folder, and if on a server, into your server's mods folder as well.
